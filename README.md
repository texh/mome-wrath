Node pass-through stream for MIME type detection.

## Install

```
npm install --save mime-stream
```

## Usage

### Event: 'type'

This event is emitted as soon as the type is detected. If the type remains
unknown, `null` is passed to the event handler instead of an object.

It is guaranteed that there is always exactly one `type` event emitted, even
when the stream is closed prematurely.

Example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const MimeStream = require("mime-stream");

let stream = new MimeStream();
stream.on("type", function (type) {
    console.log(type); // { ext: "png", mime: "image/png" }
});

fs.createReadStream("myimage.png").pipe(stream);
```

You could also add more `.pipe()` calls to the chain. `MimeStream` is
non-destructive and passes on any data it receives.

### Listener Function

This is the same as binding a function to the `type` event, just more
concise.

Example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const MimeStream = require("mime-stream");

// `new` is optional anyway
fs.createReadStream("myimage.png").pipe(MimeStream((type) => {
    console.log(type); // { ext: "png", mime: "image/png" }
}));
```

### Property

After detection, the detection result is also available inside the `type`
property. Example:

```javascript
stream.on("end", function () {
    console.log(stream.type); // { ext: "png", mime: "image/png" }
});
```
